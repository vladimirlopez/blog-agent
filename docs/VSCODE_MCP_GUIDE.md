## ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Blog Writing Workflow

### **New: Collaborative Writing Mode**
The blog-agent now supports interactive, collaborative writing where you work **with** the AI to create your blog post step by step. This mode allows you to work directly in your blog folder and have natural conversations with the AI about your content.

#### **Step 1: Start a Writing Session**
**What it does:** Creates a new writing session with the AI, initializing a conversation context and creating a draft file in your current folder.

**How to use:**
1. Open VS Code in your blog folder (not the blog-agent folder)
2. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. Type: `/start_writing_session topic="Your blog topic" blog_folder="."`

**Example:**
```
/start_writing_session topic="FastAPI Security Best Practices" blog_folder="."
```

**What happens:**
- Creates a session ID (e.g., `session_20250709_143022`)
- Initializes an empty draft file
- Sets up conversation context about your topic
- Returns session details for reference

#### **Step 2: Chat About Your Post**
**What it does:** Engage in natural conversation with the AI about your blog post. The AI remembers the context and helps you develop ideas.

**How to use:**
```
/chat_about_post session_id="your_session_id" message="Your natural language message"
```

**Examples:**
```
# Discuss focus and scope
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="I want to write about FastAPI, but focus specifically on the security aspects that developers often overlook"

# Ask for structure help
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="Can you help me structure this post with an engaging introduction, 3 main sections, and a practical conclusion?"

# Get content suggestions
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="What are the most important security vulnerabilities in FastAPI that I should cover?"

# Ask for writing help
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="Write an engaging introduction that explains why FastAPI security matters to developers"
```

**What happens:**
- AI responds with suggestions, content, or questions
- Conversation history is maintained
- Context builds up over the session

#### **Step 3: Update Your Draft**
**What it does:** Updates your draft file with new content while preserving the conversation history.

**How to use:**
```
/update_draft session_id="your_session_id" content="Your markdown content here"
```

**Example:**
```
/update_draft session_id="session_20250709_143022" content="# FastAPI Security Best Practices

## Introduction

FastAPI has become one of the most popular Python web frameworks due to its speed, ease of use, and automatic API documentation. However, with great power comes great responsibility, especially when it comes to security..."
```

**What happens:**
- Overwrites the current draft with new content
- Maintains proper Quarto/Markdown formatting
- Preserves the session for continued conversation

#### **Step 4: Save Your Draft**
**What it does:** Saves the current draft to a permanent file with proper naming and formatting.

**How to use:**
```
/save_draft session_id="your_session_id"
```

**What happens:**
- Creates a file named `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug.qmd`
- Adds proper YAML frontmatter
- Saves to your current directory
- Provides file path confirmation

#### **Step 5: Check Progress**
**What it does:** Shows you the current status of your writing session including conversation history and draft content.

**How to use:**
```
/get_session_status session_id="your_session_id"
```

**What you get:**
- Session information (topic, start time, etc.)
- Conversation history summary
- Current draft preview
- File status and location

### **Complete Example Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Start session
/start_writing_session topic="Getting Started with Docker" blog_folder="."

# 2. Discuss structure
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="I want to write a beginner-friendly guide to Docker. What should I cover?"

# 3. Get specific content
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="Write me an introduction that explains what Docker is and why beginners should care about it"

# 4. Update draft with the introduction
/update_draft session_id="session_20250709_143022" content="# Getting Started with Docker

## What is Docker and Why Should You Care?

Docker has revolutionized how we develop, deploy, and manage applications..."

# 5. Continue the conversation
/chat_about_post session_id="session_20250709_143022" message="Now help me write a section about installing Docker on different operating systems"

# 6. Save when finished
/save_draft session_id="session_20250709_143022"
```

# Building MCP Servers for VS Code Integration

Building MCP (Model-driven Cloud Platform) servers for VS Code integration is an exciting step towards streamlining your development workflow and boosting productivity. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up an MCP server tailored to seamlessly integrate with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Let's dive in!

## Introduction

Model-driven Cloud Platform offers a powerful way to build, deploy, and manage custom applications on the cloud. Integrating MCP with VS Code can provide developers with an intuitive, feature-rich environment for building and testing their applications more efficiently than ever before. In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of setting up an MCP server for VS Code integration.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. Node.js (v14 or later)
2. VS Code
3. xcode-select (for macOS) or build-essential (for Ubuntu)
4. Git

## Setting Up the MCP Server

### Step 1: Clone the MCP Repository

Begin by cloning the official MCP repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-tools.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
cd mcp-tools
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure the MCP Server

Create a new configuration file named `mcp.config.js` in the root of your project directory:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  server: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 8080,
  },
};
```

### Step 4: Start the MCP Server

Finally, start the MCP server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Integrating with VS Code

### Step 1: Install the MCP Extension

Open VS Code and search for "MCP" in the extensions marketplace. Install the official MCP extension by Microsoft.

### Step 2: Configure the MCP Extension

In VS Code, open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "MCP: Connect to Server." Follow the prompts to enter your MCP server's address and port.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you have successfully set up an MCP server for VS Code integration. Now you can leverage the power of MCP within your favorite code editor, making development easier and more efficient than ever before. Happy coding!
